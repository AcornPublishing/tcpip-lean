<h3>Analogue</h3>
The ChipWeb&#153; server uses the Microchip PIC16F877 on-chip 
analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) to read the settings of two 
potentiometers on the demonstration board. The voltage of the two 
channels (0-5V) is indicated in graphical form on the right.
<p>
Adjust one of the two potentiometers, and after a few seconds
the graphical indicators will be updated to the new value.
